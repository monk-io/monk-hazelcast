## Overview

This template provides productionâ€‘ready Hazelcast instances as Monk runnables. You can:

- Run it directly to get a managed Hazelcast container with sensible defaults
- Inherit it in your own runnable to seamlessly add distributed in-memory data grid capabilities to your stack
- Deploy as a single instance or multi-node cluster with optional management center

Hazelcast is an open-source distributed in-memory data grid (IMDG) that provides highly scalable and fault-tolerant data processing capabilities. It enables distributed caching, distributed computing, event processing, and real-time stream processing for applications requiring high-performance data operations.

## What this template manages

- Hazelcast container (`hazelcast/hazelcast` image, configurable tag)
- Network service on port 5701 (cluster communication)
- Cluster coordination and automatic member discovery
- Optional Management Center UI on port 8080
- Custom configuration via YAML file mounting

## Available templates

- **hazelcast/hazelcast** - Single Hazelcast instance
- **hazelcast/hazelcast-management** - Management Center dashboard
- **hazelcast/stack** - Single instance + Management Center
- **hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-1/2/3** - Individual cluster nodes
- **hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-management** - Cluster management dashboard
- **hazelcast-cluster/stack** - 3-node cluster + Management Center

## Quick start (run directly)

1) Load templates

```bash
monk load MANIFEST
```

2) Run Hazelcast

```bash
# Single instance only
monk run hazelcast/hazelcast

# Single instance with Management Center
monk run hazelcast/stack

# Or 3-node cluster with Management Center
monk run hazelcast-cluster/stack
```

3) Access Management Center

Once started with a stack, access the Management Center at `http://localhost:8080` to monitor your cluster, view statistics, and manage data structures.

## Configuration

Key variables you can customize in this template:

```yaml
variables:
  hazelcast-image-tag: "5.2.1"           # Hazelcast container image tag
  hazelcast-management-image-tag: "latest" # Management Center image tag
  cluster-name: "local-cluster"          # Cluster name (env: HZ_CLUSTERNAME)
```

The Hazelcast configuration is managed through a custom YAML file mounted at `/opt/hazelcast/config/hazelcast-config.yml`. You can modify `files/hazelcast-config.yml` in the template directory to customize cluster settings, networking, data structures, and more.

## Use by inheritance (recommended for apps)

Inherit the Hazelcast runnable in your application and declare a connection. Example:

```yaml
namespace: myapp

cache:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: hazelcast/hazelcast
  variables:
    cluster-name: myapp-cache-cluster

api:
  defines: runnable
  containers:
    api:
      image: myorg/api
      environment:
        - HAZELCAST_HOST=<- connection-hostname("hazelcast-cache")
        - HAZELCAST_PORT=5701
        - HAZELCAST_CLUSTER=<- $cache-cluster-name
  connections:
    hazelcast-cache:
      runnable: cache
      service: hazelcast
  variables:
    cache-cluster-name:
      value: myapp-cache-cluster
      type: string
```

Then run your app group:

```bash
monk run myapp/api
```

Your application will automatically resolve the Hazelcast hostname via the connection and can connect using the Hazelcast client library.

## Using the cluster template

For production environments requiring high availability and better performance, inherit from the cluster template:

```yaml
namespace: myapp

cache-cluster:
  defines: process-group
  runnable-list:
    - myapp/cache-node-1
    - myapp/cache-node-2
    - myapp/cache-node-3

cache-node-1:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-common
  variables:
    cluster-name: myapp-production

cache-node-2:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-common
  variables:
    cluster-name: myapp-production

cache-node-3:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-common
  variables:
    cluster-name: myapp-production
```

## Ports and connectivity

- Service: `hazelcast` on TCP port `5701` (cluster member communication)
- Management Center: `hazelcast-management` on TCP port `8080` (HTTP UI)
- From other runnables in the same process group, use `connection-hostname("<connection-name>")` to resolve the Hazelcast host.

## Configuration customization

The template includes a pre-configured `hazelcast-config.yml` file that you can customize for your needs. The configuration file supports:

- Network settings and member discovery
- Data structure configurations (maps, queues, topics, etc.)
- Serialization settings
- Security configurations
- Persistence options
- WAN replication settings

To customize, edit `files/hazelcast-config.yml` in the template directory before loading.

## Features

- **Distributed caching**: Store data across multiple nodes with automatic partitioning
- **In-memory computing**: Execute distributed tasks and aggregations
- **Event-driven architecture**: Pub/sub messaging with topics and reliable queues
- **CP and AP modes**: Choose between consistency or availability based on your needs
- **Client-server topology**: Connect multiple applications to the same cluster
- **Automatic data partitioning**: Data is automatically distributed across cluster members
- **Fault tolerance**: Data replication ensures availability during node failures
- **Dynamic scaling**: Add or remove nodes without downtime

## Management Center features

The included Management Center provides:

- Real-time cluster monitoring and health checks
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Data structure browser and management
- Query console for map entries
- Member management and monitoring
- WAN replication monitoring
- Configuration management

## Related templates

- Combine with `redis/` for complementary caching strategies
- Use with `prometheus-grafana/` for advanced metrics and observability
- Integrate with `kafka/` for event streaming pipelines

## Troubleshooting

- If cluster members aren't discovering each other, verify the `cluster-name` is identical across all nodes and check network connectivity.
- For connection issues from client applications, ensure the service port 5701 is accessible and the Hazelcast client library version is compatible with the server version.
- Management Center connection issues: verify the cluster name matches and member hostnames are resolvable.
- Check logs for detailed error messages:

```bash
# Single instance
monk logs -l 500 -f hazelcast/hazelcast

# Cluster nodes
monk logs -l 500 -f hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-1
monk logs -l 500 -f hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-2
monk logs -l 500 -f hazelcast-cluster/hazelcast-3

# Management Center
monk logs -l 500 -f hazelcast/hazelcast-management
```

- For performance tuning, adjust JVM options via the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable in the template configuration.
